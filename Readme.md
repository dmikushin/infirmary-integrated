Infirmary Integrated currently functions as a simulator for the following healthcare devices:
- Cardiac monitor
- 12-lead electocardiograph (ECG)
- Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP)
- Defibrillator (in development)

And Infirmary Integrated can simulate hemodynamic and other readings including:
- Heart rate (HR)
- Temperature (T)
- Blood pressure (NIBP non-invasive and invasive ABP via arterial line)
- Pulse oximetry (SpO2, pulse oximeter plethysmograph)
- End-tidal capnography (ETCO2)
- Central venous pressures (CVP)
- Pulmonary artery pressures (Swan-Ganz catheter pressures)
- Intra-aortic balloon pump augmentation pressures
- ST-segment elevation/depression and T-wave elevation/depression on all 12 ECG leads

Also, Infirmary Integrated simulates the following cardiac rhythms with waveforms and corresponding vital signs for scenario management:
- Asystole
- Atrial Fibrillation
- Atrial Flutter
- AV Block, 1st Degree
- AV Block, 3rd Degree
- AV Block, Mobitz II
- AV Block, Wenckebach
- Bundle Branch Block
- Idioventricular
- Junctional
- Pulseless Electrical Activity
- Sinus Rhythm
- Sinus Rhythm with Bigeminy
- Sinus Rhythm with Trigeminy
- Sinus Rhythm with PACs
- Sinus Rhythm with PJCs
