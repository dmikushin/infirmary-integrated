Infirmary Integrated is free and open-source software developed to advance healthcare education for medical and nursing professionals and students. Developed as in-depth, accurate, and accessible educational tools, Infirmary Integrated can meet the needs of clinical simulators in emergency, critical care, and many other medical and nursing specialties.

Infirmary Integrated currently functions as a simulator for the following healthcare devices:
- Cardiac monitor
- Defibrillator
- 12-lead electocardiograph (ECG)
- Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP)

And Infirmary Integrated can simulate hemodynamic and other readings including:
- Heart rate (HR)
- Temperature (T)
- Blood pressure (NIBP non-invasive and invasive ABP via arterial line)
- Pulse oximetry (SpO2, pulse oximeter plethysmograph)
- End-tidal capnography (ETCO2)
- Central venous pressure (CVP)
- Pulmonary artery pressures (Swan-Ganz catheter pressures)
- Intracranial pressure (ICP) factoring compliance in the waveform
- Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP, bladder pressure)
- Intra-aortic balloon pump augmentation pressures
- ST-segment elevation/depression and T-wave elevation/depression on all 12 ECG leads
- Defibrillation, cardioversion, and transcutaneous pacing

Also, Infirmary Integrated simulates the following cardiac rhythms with waveforms and corresponding vital signs for scenario management:
- Asystole
- Atrial Fibrillation
- Atrial Flutter
- AV Block, 1st Degree
- AV Block, 3rd Degree
- AV Block, Mobitz II
- AV Block, Wenckebach
- Bundle Branch Block
- Idioventricular
- Junctional
- Pulseless Electrical Activity
- Sinus Rhythm
- Sinus Rhythm with Bigeminy
- Sinus Rhythm with Trigeminy
- Sinus Rhythm with PACs
- Sinus Rhythm with PJCs
- Sinus Rhythm with PVCs Multifocal
- Sinus Rhythm with PVCs Unifocal
- Supraventricular Tachycardia
- Ventricular Fibrillation Coarse
- Ventricular Fibrillation Fine
- Ventricular Standstill
- Ventricular Tachycardia Monomorphic Pulsed
- Ventricular Tachycardia Monomorphic Pulseless
- Ventricular Tachycardia Polymorphic

Other main features included in Infirmary Integrated include:
- Able to pause devices to better analyze waveforms or create screenshots
- Able to mirror patient data across multiple computers
  - A teacher can host a simulation via the internet, students can access the patient simulation remotely
- Able to save simulations to files (.ii extension) that can distributed or saved
  - Device information (e.g. cardiac monitor waveforms) are also saved in simulation files

Infirmary Integrated also supports full localization (translation) for the following languages:
- አማርኛ (Amharic)
- عربى (Arabic)
- 中文 (Chinese)
- Deutsche (German)
- English
- Español (Spanish)
- فارسی (Farsi)
- Français (French)
- עברית (Hebrew)
- हिंदी (Hindi)
- Italiano (Italian)
- 한국어 (Korean)
- Português (Portuguese)
- русский (Russian)
- Swahili (Kiswahili)
